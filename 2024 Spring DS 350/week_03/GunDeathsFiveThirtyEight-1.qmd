## FiveThirtyEight Summary

FiveThirtyEight made an article several years ago which includes an interactive graph about gun violence. They used data from  the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionâ€™s Multiple Cause of Death database. The interative graph shows the demographics involved, and reasons for different gun deaths. The article argues that a better understanding of the reasons and demographics of gun death can help it better be prevented. 


```{r}

# Tibble from tidyverse, very helpful
guns <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data/master/full_data.csv")


```

```{r}
head(gun)

ggplot(gun, aes(x = police, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "Involvement of Police", y = "Count", fill = "Gender") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Gender by Police Involvement")
```
```{r}
year_gender_totals <- gun %>%
  group_by(year, sex) %>%
  summarize(total = n())

# Plot using ggplot2
ggplot(year_gender_totals, aes(x = year, y = total, color = sex, group = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Total Incidents", color = "Gender", 
       title = "Total Gun Incidents by Year and Gender") +
  theme_minimal()
```
