# All samples are wrong

# Distribution obtained by repeatedly sampling population
# 'fishing'

# Having x values spread widely across the min-max of the possibilities is better than having them
# in just one spot.

# Statistics is where math meets the variation of reality.

# Averages are quite stable. Individuals vary, the population is overall consistent.
# Casinos, Lotteries, Insurance.

# How confident can we be, if we get a sample, of our data?
# How can we know when to trust, and when not to trust our sample?
