But if you try to fight back he has massive shields on W and two free target dashes with CC built in plus the extra damage on E which can even cleanse CC. Trynda has infinite dashes with his E resets so you can't run, but also removes your AD with W and becomes unkillable with ult so you can't fight. If there's a clear window of weakness to exploit, it's ok, but some champs have all the agency on when they get to fight you and seem to require a misplay to be killable, so it never feels like you get to punish them or beat them with your skill, it's more they outplayed themselves.

Other assassins only really become broken when fed but Zed's ult allows him to still kill the ADC when behind. On top of this Zed has the lowest skill floor out of all the assasins making him a menace as every other game has a Zed in it. ,"I tend to ban the champion that I play worst against with the highest pickrate, currently Xerath as I know I'll get hit by his stun atleast once during laning phase if he gets through (I am bot main).","Lack of counterplay. 

Tryndamere for an exmaple can't be killed in his ult, heals to fast to be 1v1'd by many champions, can't be chased because of his spin and slow and you can't run away from him because of the same abilities. Other example is Zed, he has too much mobility to easily kill him pre-6 and after 6 he can just press R to get a garanteed kill on any squishy.

With these champions you often have to play the entire game around that one opponent and then still it's not garanteed to make you win. 
",No,Cinnamon Rolls,"Every champion is annoying when fed, but only those without or with little counterplay options are truly tilting in my opinion.

Carries like Ryze/ Azir/ Kassadin can be annoying but are free gold during the first 15 minutes. Vayne has mobility, cc and stealth already at game start, the only counterplay is picking the right champion into her. Other wise you'r pretty much screwed.

Assassing/mages can be annoying when fed (eg Leblanc, Kha'zix, Lux etc.) but only some will still ruin your day when behind and those are the really tilting ones. Zed or Brand are good examples. Both can still act as an ult bot from behind and will still do well in that position."

In Shaco's ideal situation, you are simultaneously guessing which clone is real and fake, dodging boxes that you have to assume are placed, and trying to hit one of the most slippery characters in the game. If he's AP, you can get 1 shot from cc from walking into 1 box or from him ulting and just sending his clone after you to explode. If he's AD, he can stealth right next to you and one shot you with crit and lethality and get away due to his untargetability of his ultimate and his short range stealth dash. Melee champions literally cannot even clear his boxes with red trinket as they will proc as soon as you walk in range. Both of these playstyles are extremely frustrating to play against as it feels more like it requires the Shaco player themselves to mess up rather than you outplay them. ","I think the champions I tilt over are just generally bad matchups (but I don't tilt specifically because they're bad matchups, I tilt because the characters employ very 1 dimension gameplay patterns that require them to usually only success at one thing to work).","All of the above.

Take Yone for example, he has deals around a 40/40/20 split of physical/magic/true damage so itemizing against him in a meaningful way is not really possible apart from items that just flat out reduce AA damage, he is sufficient in both short and long trades due to his high DPS and W shield and E true damage stacking up over long trades and has a way out every 3rd Q (not to even bring up his insane scaling with Lethal tempo that just should not be allowed). Note that yes, his teamfights are hard to play unless you get a juicy 3-5 man R but that small con does not outweigh his strong and dominant laning phase. Jax and Akali would be great examples for agency or uncounterable abilities. If my champ relies on AAs, as a lot of champs do, they can make me useless for a few seconds at the press of a button.

Imagine you play a champ for many seasons and then there is a new released one and can do everything better then your champ.,Yes,Freshly baked Brownies,There is tilt that comes from not knowing enough about the game. I might not know everything. But Riots way of buffing and nerfing champs does tilt mostly because its inconsistent. Like they give a reason to nerf a champ and it was really needed. Later on they buff him more then pre nerfs and the let that champ roam as a monster for months without recognizing it simply because they are looking too much at wr and br wich arent the only indicators for balance. Like most players lose games because of bad decisions or not playing around their strenghts or much more. Most of the time true dmg or %dmg are tilting because there is no real counter play against it. Besides that special interaction like ability resets are extremely annoying. Dashes too. Many mages are reliant on skill shots. When every second mid laner has dashes now it gets really frustrating. Especially if you need all your skills to hit to kill or endanger the enemy but they can miss half of their skills but you still die.

You quite literally cannot punish her, her poke is nigh-unmissable, and post laning phase she jumps onto a carry or bruiser to make them unstoppable.

Yuumi is way too easy to play, Senna's kit is annoying/you just have to take the damage she deals to you early game, Seraphine's kit is annoying, et cetera.

",No,Freshly baked Brownies,"I think the vast majority of tilt comes from individuals taking League far too seriously. I, of course, get frustrated but the most I’ll do is ping an enemy bounty or champ portrait. I’ve played with chat off for over a year so I’ve never said anything rude to anyone.

Tilt is inevitable in a game like League but the little flair text Riot gives in loading screens about detilt is actually good advice. I think that despite how a game may be going there is never a legitimate reason to flame someone in chat or continually harass them throughout a game. Definitely room to call people out for bad plays but when people try to make someone truly feel bad about it, they’re the asshole. Every other champ you see is being played by another person just like you, and that thought keeps me from really tilting, because nothing is that deep to warrant me saying something. "

I would like to say that what is tilting is subjective but when something subjective and is all about just feeling ( not as in case you have feeling that you see light grey but its dark grey i.e. optic illusions and etc. I mean literally just emotions. ) and all come into agreement that something is annoying then it can be objectified. Also things that have clear purpose of being tilting are bad but again, whether they are tiling or not is subjective.

I personally hate when I dont have things under my control and dont get properly rewarded. I also hate injustice so when some lil shit gets away with winning just because he picked this or that then I get mad but I dont hate losing. If someone clearly better beats me, I am even happy that I got to play against someone better or at least I feel nothing as if it even wasnt me who lost but 3rd person.
